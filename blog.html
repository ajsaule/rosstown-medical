										<h2>What You Need to Know Before Getting the COVID Vaccine, from a Carnegie Doctor</h2>
										<h3>James Patrick | 21/06/2022</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We know that there are so many different vaccines out there that it can be overwhelming to try and figure out which one you should get, and what the differences are between them. You might have also heard about newly-developed COVID vaccines, but you might not know exactly what they do or how they work.
									Luckily, our principal doctor Dr. Andrew Patrick at Rosstown Family Medical Centre can help you clarify any worries you have about the vaccine, including the basics and how safe it is. As a Carnegie medical centre, we’ve put together this brief post on the things you need to know before getting the COVID vaccine.</p>

									<h3>The Basics: Who Should Get It?</h3>

									<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 primary series vaccines are suitable for everyone ages 6 months and older, and COVID-19 boosters for everyone ages 5 years and older, if eligible. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have specific recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters.</p>
									
									<p>This means it’s not safe for everyone; in fact, it may not be safe at all for certain people. That’s why you should have our doctor check your medical history before getting vaccinated. Read on to learn more about the vaccine—and whom it may be best suited for.</p>

									<h3>How Safe Is It?</h3>

									<p> To ensure safety, all COVID-19 vaccinations are protected by strict regulations. COVID-19 vaccines must be tested in clinical trials before they are approved by WHO or national regulatory agencies. 
									At Rosstown Family Medical Centre in Carnegie our doctors help oversee our research. While they can't make recommendations or prescriptions, they can provide some helpful advice regarding your options.</p>

									<h3>Will My Insurance Cover It?</h3>

								  <p> The majority of insurance plans cover immunizations. However, there are some variations between health plans; always check with your provider before visiting a medical clinic for immunization. Depending on your provider and location, you may need to pay out-of-pocket or have an office visit before receiving your vaccination (typically if you're getting multiple vaccines). At the Rosstown Family Medical Clinic, you won’t need to pay if you are a Medicare card holder.</p>

									<h3>Where Can I Get It Done?</h3>

									<p>Several clinics are administering the COVID vaccine locally, but if you're in Carnegie, Melbourne, you can get vaccinated by one of our doctors at the Rosstown Family Medical Clinic. The medical clinic is located at 73 Rosstown Rd and provides covid vaccines for our patients given we agree with your medical history being compatible with the vaccine.</p> 

									<p>The Rosstown Family Medical Clinic has been providing healthcare services in Melbourne for decades; our clinic has practiced routine health maintenance for over four decades. In that time, we have kept up with every new medical advancement so that we can continue our work of keeping everyone who lives in Carnegie healthy.</p> 

									<p>If you want to get your COVID vaccine at Rosstown Family Clinic, there are two ways you can get it done:</p> 
										<ol>
											<li>1) Schedule an appointment over the phone or </li>
											<li>2) Walk into our clinic during any of our operating hours</li>
										</ol>
