										<h2>In-Home Care for the Elderly: Carnegie Doctors Share Their Top Tips</h2>
										<h3>Rosstown Family Medical Centre | 28/06/2022</h3>
									</header>
									<h3>In-Home Care for the Elderly: Carnegie Doctors Share Their Top Tips</h3>
									<p>Caring for elderly family members can be challenging, especially if you don’t know what to expect and what might happen next. Luckily, the doctors at Rosstown Medical Centre are sharing their top tips on how to care for the elderly. 
									Carnegie doctors are sharing these tips in the hope that they will help you care better to avoid common problems that many families face when caring for an elderly loved one. With these Carnegie GP tips, you can feel more confident in helping your loved one age well at home and in the community, while keeping them safe and independent as they grow older.

									<h3>Rosstown Medical Carnegie Doctors Eldercare Top Tips</h3>
									<p>If you have an elderly person in a hospital or nursing home, you may not have to do a lot to care for them. However, if you have to care for them at home, you’ll need all the professional (GP Carnegie) tips you can get. Here are some of the top tips from Rosstown Family Carnegie Medical Centre:</p>
									
									<h3>1) Figure out their most important needs</h3>
									<p>To address the needs of an elderly person, you must first understand what those needs are. The single most important need for most seniors is to be treated with respect and compassion by their caregivers, whether or not they are relatives. You also have to know the state of their overall health and what exactly they need or can’t do themselves.
									
									<h3>2) Help them stay active</h3>
									<p>As we age, our bodies change. Some of us begin to feel tired more often or have trouble remembering things. The risk of developing a medical condition increases with age, too—but these conditions are treatable and manageable if detected early. To help your loved one stay active, live longer, and avoid a visit to doctors Carnegie, help them get at least 150 minutes of light to moderate exercise weekly.</p>
									
									<h3>3) Install safety features in the house</h3>
									<p>Before caring for an elderly relative or friend, find out what they have in place—including smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors—and see if there are any updates or upgrades you can make.</p>
									
									<p>Your loved one might need a walker to assist with balance; you can search for “doctors near me” to get fitted for one. Seniors typically don’t want (or need) something as sturdy as adult-sized versions, but weight limitations should be taken into account when selecting a device.</p>
									
									<h3>4) Help them with their medical care</h3>
									<p>Make sure your loved one is able to see his or her doctor regularly. If they're showing symptoms of health problems, search for “doctors near me,” “Carnegie GP,” or “Carnegie Medical Centre.” You can find experienced Carnegie doctors at 73 Rosstown Rd, Carnegie to help with medical appointments.</p>

									<p>You can also check out “GP Carnegie” and find out about local family medical clinics or family medical services in Carnegie. These days, there are a lot of options when it comes to finding a suitable service provider or doctor that is both convenient and inexpensive for people who are living with an illness or simply seeking regular checkups on a long-term basis.</p>
									
									<h3>5) Take care of their important paperwork</h3>
									<p>Aging can bring about a variety of financial problems and expenses, including medical bills and home safety improvements. Your elderly relative may require additional financial support if they are retired. Talk with your elderly relative about their financial resources (such as retirement savings or pensions) and create a plan to help. This can make all the difference in their golden years.
									
									<p>That said, the most important tip to care for seniors is to be there for them and shower them with love and care. Whether they are being handled by Carnegie doctors or not, most of the time all they need is someone to tell their unending stories to.</p>

										<h2>What You Need to Know Before Getting the COVID Vaccine, from a Carnegie Doctor</h2>
										<h3>Rosstown Family Medical Centre | 21/06/2022</h3>
									</header>
									<p>We know that there are so many different vaccines out there that it can be overwhelming to try and figure out which one you should get, and what the differences are between them. You might have also heard about newly-developed COVID vaccines, but you might not know exactly what they do or how they work.
									Luckily, our principal doctor Dr. Andrew Patrick at Rosstown Family Medical Centre can help you clarify any worries you have about the vaccine, including the basics and how safe it is. As a Carnegie medical centre, we’ve put together this brief post on the things you need to know before getting the COVID vaccine.</p>

									<h3>The Basics: Who Should Get It?</h3>

									<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the COVID-19 primary series vaccines are suitable for everyone ages 6 months and older, and COVID-19 boosters for everyone ages 5 years and older, if eligible. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have specific recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters.</p>
									
									<p>This means it's not safe for everyone, you should have our doctor check your medical history before getting vaccinated. Read on to learn more about the vaccine—and whom it may be best suited for.</p>

									<h3>How Safe Is It?</h3>

									<p> To ensure safety, all COVID-19 vaccinations are protected by strict regulations. COVID-19 vaccines must be tested in clinical trials before they are approved by WHO or national regulatory agencies. 
									At Rosstown Family Medical Centre in Carnegie our doctors help oversee our research. While they can't make recommendations or prescriptions, they can provide some helpful advice regarding your options.</p>

									<h3>Will My Insurance Cover It?</h3>

								  <p> The majority of insurance plans cover immunizations. However, there are some variations between health plans; always check with your provider before visiting a medical clinic for immunization. Depending on your provider and location, you may need to pay out-of-pocket or have an office visit before receiving your vaccination (typically if you're getting multiple vaccines). At the Rosstown Family Medical Clinic, you won’t need to pay if you are a Medicare card holder.</p>

									<h3>Where Can I Get It Done?</h3>

									<p>Several clinics are administering the COVID vaccine locally, but if you're in Carnegie, Melbourne, you can get vaccinated by one of our doctors at the Rosstown Family Medical Clinic. The medical clinic is located at 73 Rosstown Rd and provides covid vaccines for our patients given we agree with your medical history being compatible with the vaccine.</p> 

									<p>The Rosstown Family Medical Clinic has been providing healthcare services in Melbourne for decades; our clinic has practiced routine health maintenance for over four decades. In that time, we have kept up with every new medical advancement so that we can continue our work of keeping everyone who lives in Carnegie healthy.</p> 

									<p>If you want to get your COVID vaccine at Rosstown Family Clinic, there are two ways you can get it done:</p> 
										<ol>
											<li>1) Schedule an appointment over the phone or </li>
											<li>2) Walk into our clinic during any of our operating hours</li>
										</ol>
